# Object Detection with YOLOv3 using ImageAI

This repository contains code for performing object detection using the YOLOv3 model with the ImageAI library. The code provided here includes both image and video object detection using pre-trained YOLOv3 models.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the code in this repository, you'll need to download the YOLOv3 model file. You can download it from the official ImageAI repository on GitHub: [ImageAI - YOLOv3 Model](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/tree/master/imageai/Detection).

Once you have downloaded the YOLOv3 model file, make sure to place it in a folder named `YOLOv3` within the same directory as the code files.

## File Structure

- `ObjectDetectionWithYOLOv3.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file demonstrates how to perform object detection on a single image using the YOLOv3 model and save the result as an image.

- `VideoObjectDetectionWithYOLOv3.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file demonstrates how to perform object detection on a video using the YOLOv3 model and save the result as a new video.

- `data/`: This folder contains the input images and videos required for running the code, as well as the output image and video files generated by the provided code. Specifically, it includes:
  - `data/tehran.png`: The input image for the image object detection example.
  - `data/driving_camera.mp4`: The input video for the video object detection example.
  - `data/04-tehran-detected.jpg`: The output image from the image object detection example.
  - `data/street_camera_det.mp4`: The output video from the video object detection example.

## Usage

1. Download the YOLOv3 model file from the provided link and place it in the `YOLOv3` folder within the same directory as the code files.

2. Open and run either `ObjectDetectionWithYOLOv3.ipynb` for image object detection or `VideoObjectDetectionWithYOLOv3.ipynb` for video object detection.

3. The code will load the YOLOv3 model, perform object detection, and save the results as specified in the code.

4. You can find the output image and video in the `data/` folder.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific object detection needs.

Enjoy using YOLOv3 for object detection with ImageAI! If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the ImageAI documentation or raise an issue on the official repository.
